		OpenHacha
		=========

	The beginning
	--------------
	
	This project was based on Sierra (http://sierra.sourceforge.net/), a
	free implementation of the Hacha for MS Windows program
	(http://www.hachaweb.com). Sierra developed two implementations
	(Python and C#), and a simple text based frontend.

	I took the work made in C# as starting point for OpenHacha. 

	
	The future
	----------
	
	For the 0.3 release and up, OpenHacha works with libhacha2, from the Dalle 
	project (http://dalle.sourceforge.net). This new library supports all Hacha
	file formats (v1, v2 and pro).

	
	The freedom
	-----------

	This project aims to provide a Gtk# frontend and a text console client to
	manage and create Hacha files.
